## Installation

You first need to get yadm. In OSX it's `brew install yadm` and on Ubuntu it's 
`apt install git yadm`.

Once you have that you should fork this repo and then `yadm clone <your fork url>`.
It should ask you whether to run the bootstrap file. Answer yes and it'll be installed 
and configured for you.

If it fails, please copy the screen output and paste into an issue and mark it as a bug.
